/**
 * Backs the `@Idempotent(scope)` decorator (#16).
 *
 * The safety property this provides — two concurrent requests carrying the
 * same Idempotency-Key/scope/caller never both execute the underlying
 * mutation — comes entirely from `idempotency_keys`' unique index on
 * (key, scope, callerId), not from anything in this class. `claim()` always
 * *attempts* a plain `insert()` and reacts to a unique-violation rather than
 * checking-then-inserting, because a JS-level "does a row exist?" check
 * followed by a separate insert has the same TOCTOU gap the issue warns
 * about — the database constraint is what actually closes it.
 *
 * Response caching policy: a 2xx or 4xx outcome is a definite, deterministic
 * result of the request, so it's cached and replayed verbatim on retry. A
 * 5xx (or any non-HttpException failure) is *not* cached — the key is
 * released instead — because forcing every future retry to replay a server
 * error forever is worse than letting the retry try again cleanly.
 *
  * Caller scoping: none of the controllers this guards (bounties, escrow,
  * milestones, maintenance-pool) currently sit behind JwtAuthGuard, so there
  * is no authenticated caller to scope by yet. `resolveCallerId` falls back
  * to a per-scope fingerprint of (IP + User-Agent) in that case to reduce
  * the collision surface area — see its doc comment for details.
 *
 * Request identity: `scope` is a static string per route (e.g.
 * 'escrow.release'), the same for every request to that route regardless
 * of path params or body — so (key, scope, callerId) alone can't tell two
 * different resources (or two different payloads) apart. `resolveExisting`
 * additionally compares a SHA-256 fingerprint of path params + body
 * (`computeRequestFingerprint`) against the fingerprint stored on the
 * existing row, and rejects with 422 on a mismatch rather than replaying
 * the wrong cached response (#54). This binds identity via the body-hash
 * comparison rather than folding path params into `scope` itself — scope
 * stays a purely route-level concept (matches its existing "unique per
 * scope, not globally" contract), and one mechanism covers both path
 * params and body instead of two.
